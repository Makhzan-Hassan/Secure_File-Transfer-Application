🔒 Secure File Transfer Application  

I developed a Secure File Transfer Application using Python. The application ensures end-to-end encryption to protect files during transfer, implementing:  

✅ Confidentiality & Integrity – Encrypts files using Fernet encryption
✅ Access Controls – Requires authentication before file operations  
✅ Audit Logs – Tracks encryption and decryption activities  

A great project for learning cybersecurity, encryption, and secure file handling!  

 🚀 Tech Used:  
- Python 🐍  
- Cryptography (Fernet) 🔐  
- JSON for Audit Logs 📝  

Feel free to explore, use, and improve it! 🚀
